This week, we rolled out significant enhancements to OpenBook's core features. Our new search algorithm now surfaces relevant notes faster, while the interface updates offer a cleaner, more intuitive experience.

We also introduced dark-mode optimizations and performance improvements under the hood. Stay tuned for next week's release, where we'll add collaborative editing so you can study together in real time.
