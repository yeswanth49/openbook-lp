# Warm Light Theme Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the steps needed to add a light/warm theme to the OpenBook landing page.

## Current State Analysis

- The site currently uses a dark theme by default
- Theme switching is managed by `next-themes` library
- Default theme is set to "light" in the app/layout.tsx but not fully implemented
- Particle background is currently using white particles on dark background
- The dot pattern background is tied to the current theme color

## Implementation Steps

1. **✅ Update Theme Variables in CSS**
   - ✅ Ensure proper warm light mode variables are defined in globals.css
   - ✅ Create proper contrast between light and dark modes
   - ✅ Adjust gradient text for theme consistency

2. **✅ Create Theme Toggle Component**
   - ✅ Implement a ThemeToggle component using next-themes
   - ✅ Use sun/moon icons for clear visual representation
   - ✅ Position in the header for easy access

3. **✅ Update Background Components**
   - ✅ Modify ParticleBackground to adjust particle colors based on theme
   - ✅ Update dot pattern SVG to be visible on light backgrounds

4. **✅ Update Layout Configuration**
   - ✅ Add suppressHydrationWarning to html element
   - ✅ Set default theme to "system"
   - ✅ Add dot-pattern class to body element

5. **✅ Documentation**
   - ✅ Update learned-memories with theme information
   - ✅ Document implemented changes

## Completed Changes

### 1. CSS Variables Update
- Added warm light mode HSL variables in globals.css (avoiding pure white)
- Used subtle warm tones (30° hue) for background and containers
- Made gradient-text and split-text classes theme-aware

### 2. Theme Toggle Component
- Created components/theme-toggle.tsx
- Used sun/moon icons with smooth transition animation
- Added toggle to both desktop and mobile navigation

### 3. Background Components
- Updated ParticleBackground to show warm brown particles on light background
- Added theme-awareness to connecting lines
- Updated dot pattern to use a subtle warm brown color in light mode

### 4. Layout Configuration
- Updated app/layout.tsx to use system theme by default
- Added suppressHydrationWarning to prevent flashing
- Applied dot-pattern class to body for consistent background

## Testing

To test the theme toggle functionality:
1. Run the development server (`npm run dev`)
2. Navigate to any page on the site
3. Click the sun/moon icon in the header
4. Verify that the following elements correctly change:
   - Background color (warm off-white in light mode)
   - Text color
   - Particle color (warm brown in light mode)
   - Dot pattern color
   - UI components (buttons, cards, etc.)
5. Test on mobile to ensure the toggle in the mobile menu works

## Next Steps (If Needed)

- Fine-tune specific component colors if needed
- Add theme persistence using localStorage
- Consider adding themed logo variants
