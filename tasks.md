# Footer Implementation Action Plan

## Current State Analysis

The footer implementation currently has the following components:

1. `CombinedFooter.tsx` - A component that includes both the footer content and the background effects
2. `footer.tsx` - A standard footer component with links and information
3. `footer-text.tsx` - A component that renders just the background text effect
4. `footer.module.css` - CSS module with styling for the footer effects

## Issues Identified

Based on the screenshot and codebase analysis:

1. There appears to be a visual issue with the footer background text "OpenBook" positioning/display
2. The current implementation has redundant components (footer.tsx and parts of CombinedFooter.tsx contain duplicated code)
3. There may be z-index or layering issues causing the footer content to be improperly displayed or the background text to overlap content

## Action Plan

### 1. Refactor Footer Components Structure

1. Remove redundant components:
   - Keep `CombinedFooter.tsx` as the main footer component
   - Delete `footer-text.tsx` as its functionality is already in CombinedFooter
   - Delete `footer.tsx` once we confirm CombinedFooter works correctly

2. Improve semantic HTML:
   - Ensure the footer uses proper semantic HTML tags
   - Use appropriate ARIA attributes for accessibility 

### 2. Fix Visual Styling Issues

1. Adjust the footer background text:
   - Fix the positioning of the "OpenBook" text (currently set to `bottom: -30%` which may cause it to be cut off)
   - Adjust opacity and text size for better visibility
   - Test different positioning options: centered, offset, or fully visible

2. Improve the layering of elements:
   - Ensure z-index values are properly set for all elements
   - Verify the grid overlay and gradient are properly positioned
   - Make sure content is always readable above the effects

3. Responsive design improvements:
   - Test on different screen sizes to ensure the footer is fully responsive
   - Adjust the clamp values for the footer text size to work well on all screens

### 3. Implementation Approach

1. Update `footer.module.css`:
   - Adjust the CSS variables for better text sizing
   - Fix positioning of the background text
   - Improve the gradient and grid overlay effects

2. Refine `CombinedFooter.tsx`:
   - Ensure proper semantic HTML structure
   - Verify z-index values for proper layering
   - Add appropriate responsive classes

3. Update the imports in `page.tsx`:
   - Ensure the footer is imported and used correctly

### 4. Testing

1. Visual testing:
   - Test on various screen sizes
   - Verify text is visible and properly positioned
   - Check that all links and content are accessible

2. Accessibility testing:
   - Ensure proper contrast ratios
   - Verify semantic HTML structure
   - Check keyboard navigation

## Questions to Clarify

1. Should the "OpenBook" background text be fully visible or partially visible?
2. What is the preferred position of the background text (top, center, bottom)?
3. Should the background effects (grid and gradient) be more or less prominent?
4. Are there any specific responsive behaviors needed for mobile views?
