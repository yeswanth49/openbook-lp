   - `components/animations/BookOpeningAnimation.module.css` - Associated CSS module to be deleted ✅

2. **Implementation Files:**
   - `app/page.tsx` - Where the animation is imported and used ✅

3. **Backup Files:**
   - `components/animations/backups/BookOpeningAnimation.tsx` - Backup version to be deleted ✅
   - `components/animations/backups/BookOpeningAnimation.tsx.bak` - Another backup version to be deleted ✅
   - `components/animations/backups/BookOpeningAnimation.module.css` - Backup CSS module to be deleted ✅
   - `components/animations/backups/BookOpeningAnimation.module.css.bak` - Another backup CSS module to be deleted ✅

4. **Documentation:**
   - `docs/book.md` - Documentation file that can be deleted or archived ✅

## Step-by-Step Removal Process

### Step 1: Modify the Landing Page Component ✅
1. Open `app/page.tsx` ✅
2. Remove the dynamic import for BookOpeningAnimation: ✅
   ```tsx
   const BookOpeningAnimation = dynamic(() => import('@/components/animations/BookOpeningAnimation'), {
     loading: () => <div className="flex items-center justify-center h-screen">Loading animation...</div>,
     ssr: false
   })
   ```
3. Remove the animation-related state variables: ✅
   ```tsx
   const [showAnimation, setShowAnimation] = useState(!SKIP_ANIMATION)
   const [showLandingContent, setShowLandingContent] = useState(SKIP_ANIMATION)
   ```
4. Remove the handleAnimationComplete function ✅
5. Remove the conditional rendering of animation component: ✅
   ```tsx
   {showAnimation ? (
     <BookOpeningAnimation onAnimationComplete={handleAnimationComplete} />
   ) : (
     // ...
   ```
6. Ensure landing content is always shown by removing conditional rendering: ✅
   ```tsx
   {showLandingContent && <Header />}
   ```
   Replace with:
   ```tsx
   <Header />
   ```
7. Remove the SKIP_ANIMATION constant and related logic ✅

### Step 2: Delete Animation Component Files ✅
1. Delete `components/animations/BookOpeningAnimation.tsx` ✅
2. Delete `components/animations/BookOpeningAnimation.module.css` ✅
3. Delete backup versions: ✅
   - `components/animations/backups/BookOpeningAnimation.tsx` ✅
   - `components/animations/backups/BookOpeningAnimation.tsx.bak` ✅
   - `components/animations/backups/BookOpeningAnimation.module.css` ✅
   - `components/animations/backups/BookOpeningAnimation.module.css.bak` ✅

### Step 3: Clean up Documentation ✅
1. Archive or delete `docs/book.md` ✅
2. Update any other documentation that may reference the book animation ✅

### Step 4: Test the Application ✅
1. Start the development server ✅
2. Verify that:
   - The landing page loads directly without animation ✅
   - All UI elements appear correctly ✅
   - No console errors related to the removed animation ✅

### Step 5: Review Unused Dependencies ✅
1. Check if the animation used any dependencies that are no longer needed ✅
2. No unique dependencies were found that need removal ✅

## Verification Checklist
- [x] Landing page loads without errors ✅
- [x] All UI components render correctly ✅
- [x] No animation-related files remain in the codebase ✅
- [x] No unused animation-related imports or code remains ✅
- [x] No console errors related to the removed animation ✅

## Summary
The book animation has been successfully removed from the OpenBook landing page. The page now loads directly without the initial animation, providing a faster and more straightforward user experience. All animation-related files have been removed from the codebase, and no issues were encountered during testing.

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise, the animation files can be restored from version control, and the changes to `app/page.tsx` can be reverted.
