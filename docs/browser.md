# Browser Performance Optimization Plan

## Problem Statement
The website is experiencing significant lag in Arc browser, while performing well in Safari. The goal is to optimize performance across all browsers without changing the landing page sections.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Canvas-based background** - The `BeamsBackground` component uses a Canvas with intensive animations that may not be efficiently handled by all browsers
2. **Heavy animation libraries** - Extensive use of Framer Motion for animations across the site
3. **Multiple stacked animations** - Many concurrent animations with opacity, blur, and transforms
4. **Inefficient component loading** - Some dynamic imports may be causing render delays
5. **Missing performance optimizations** - No explicit browser performance optimizations

## Action Plan

### 1. Optimize Background Animation
- [ ] Implement RAF throttling for the canvas animation
- [ ] Reduce the number of beams rendered based on device capability
- [ ] Add browser detection to simplify animations in problematic browsers
- [ ] Implement a simpler fallback for browsers with performance issues

### 2. Optimize Framer Motion Usage
- [ ] Consolidate animation variants to reduce re-renders
- [ ] Use `layoutId` for shared element transitions instead of separate animations
- [ ] Implement progressive enhancement with reduced motion preferences
- [ ] Add browser-specific optimizations for Arc

### 3. Implement Resource Loading Optimizations
- [ ] Convert large images to WebP format with proper sizing
- [ ] Implement proper lazy loading of offscreen content
- [ ] Add loading priority to critical resources
- [ ] Add font display optimization strategies

### 4. Code Splitting and Bundle Optimization
- [ ] Analyze bundle size with `npm run analyze` to identify large dependencies
- [ ] Optimize component loading with proper suspense boundaries
- [ ] Implement module chunking for better resource loading
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies and code

### 5. Add Browser-Specific Optimizations
- [ ] Implement feature detection for problematic browsers
- [ ] Add browser-specific CSS optimizations
- [ ] Use progressive enhancement techniques for animations
- [ ] Add GPU acceleration hints where appropriate

### 6. Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Add real user monitoring for performance metrics
- [ ] Implement Core Web Vitals tracking
- [ ] Set up alerts for performance regressions
- [ ] Create browser-specific performance test scenarios

## Implementation Priority
1. Background animation optimization (highest impact)
2. Resource loading optimizations
3. Framer Motion animation optimizations
4. Code splitting and bundle optimization
5. Browser-specific optimizations
6. Performance monitoring

## Expected Outcomes
- Consistent performance across all browsers
- Improved Core Web Vitals scores
- Reduced bundle sizes
- Smoother animations with lower CPU/GPU usage
