# Section Separator Implementation in Main Page

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for adding section separators to the main `page.tsx` file to create clear visual distinctions between content sections.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Create example of section separator in `examples/section-seperator/page.tsx`.
- [x] Document general implementation plan in `docs/plus.md`.
- [x] Create a reusable `SectionSeparator` component in `components/ui/section-separator.tsx`.
- [x] Implement section separators in the main `page.tsx` file.

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Refine styling and responsiveness of separators.
- [ ] Add animation effects to separators.
- [ ] Implement theme support for separators.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created Reusable Component

- Created file `components/ui/section-separator.tsx` with the following implementation:

```tsx
import React from "react";

interface SectionSeparatorProps {
  /**
   * The icon or text to display in the center of the separator
   */
  icon?: React.ReactNode;
  
  /**
   * Optional additional className for custom styling
   */
  className?: string;
}

export function SectionSeparator({ 
  icon = "+", 
  className = "" 
}: SectionSeparatorProps) {
  return (
    <div className={`flex items-center text-gray-400 my-8 ${className}`}>
      <span className="flex-grow border-t border-gray-300" />
      <span className="mx-4">{icon}</span>
      <span className="flex-grow border-t border-gray-300" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 2. Identified Sections in Main Page

Added section separators between the following major sections in `app/page.tsx`:
- After the Hero section
- After the Key Features section
- After the Core Features Grid
- After the Interface Preview section
- After the Natural Language Interaction section
- After the Productivity Benefits section
- After the Blog section
- Before the Call to Action section

### 3. Implementation in Main Page

- Imported the `SectionSeparator` component in `page.tsx`:
  ```tsx
  import { SectionSeparator } from "@/components/ui/section-separator"
  ```

- Added the component between each major section:
  ```tsx
  <section>
    {/* Section content */}
  </section>
  
  <SectionSeparator />
  
  <section>
    {/* Next section content */}
  </section>
  ```

### 4. Visual Result

The section separators provide a clean, minimal way to visually separate different content sections on the landing page. Each separator consists of:
- A horizontal line extending from both sides
- A centered "+" symbol
- Consistent spacing above and below

This implementation matches the design seen in the reference image where sections are clearly separated with a line and "+" icon.
