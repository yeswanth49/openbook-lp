# Project Memory

This file stores project-specific knowledge, conventions, and user preferences learned by the AI assistant.

## User Preferences

- Dark theme is used throughout the site with a dot pattern background
- Particle background should be visible on all pages

## Technical Decisions

- Using Next.js App Router with page.tsx files
- Using Tailwind CSS for styling
- Header component is reused across pages
- ParticleBackground component is included in the root layout and should be visible throughout all pages
- Page components should not override the background or add containers that hide the particle effect

## Project Conventions

- Design system emphasizes dark background with gradient text accents and particle animations
- "gradient-text" class is used for headline emphasis
- Content is organized in section blocks with consistent spacing (mb-24)
- About page contains: Mission, Why We Started, Open Source, Founders, Contact sections
- Page content should be wrapped in relative z-10 containers to appear above the particle background
