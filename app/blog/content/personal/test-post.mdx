# Main Heading

This is a paragraph with **bold text**, *italic text*, and `inline code`. Let's see how it renders.

## Secondary Heading

Here's a bullet list:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3 with **bold** formatting

### Tertiary Heading

Here's a numbered list:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item with *italic* formatting

#### Fourth Level Heading

> This is a blockquote. It should have a special styling.

##### Code Blocks

```javascript
// This is a code block
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

###### Tables

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
| Cell 4   | Cell 5   | Cell 6   |

## Links

[This is a link](https://example.com)

## Images

Unfortunately, we can't test images properly in this demo file since we don't have access to actual images.

## Nested Lists

1. First level
   - Nested bullet
   - Another nested bullet
2. Back to first level
   1. Nested number
   2. Another nested number

## Task Lists

- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Incomplete task

That's it! If all these elements render properly, our MDX styling is working correctly.
