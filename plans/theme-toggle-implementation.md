# Theme Toggle Implementation with Warm Light Mode

This document tracks the implementation of the theme toggle feature that allows switching between dark and warm light modes.

## Feature Overview

The OpenBook site now supports both dark and warm light themes via a toggle button in the navigation header. Users can switch between themes with a single click, and the site appearance updates instantly.

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

1. **ThemeToggle Component** - A new button component with sun/moon icons
   - Located at: `components/theme-toggle.tsx`
   - Uses `next-themes` to manage theme state

2. **CSS Theme Variables**
   - Updated `app/globals.css` with warm light mode color variables
   - Used subtle warm tones (30Â° hue) to avoid pure white
   - Made existing styled components (gradient-text, dot-pattern) theme-aware

3. **ParticleBackground Updates**
   - Modified to render warm brown particles (101, 67, 33) on light background
   - Added theme detection using useTheme hook

4. **Header Integration**
   - Added toggle to desktop and mobile navigation in `components/header.tsx`

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Created ThemeToggle component
- [x] Updated globals.css with warm light theme variables (avoiding pure white)

## Testing Results

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for this feature could include:
